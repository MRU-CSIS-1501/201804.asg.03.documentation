# Assignment 03

## Challenge: The Josephus Problem

### Preamble

_Spend 14 minutes of your life and watch this video first: https://youtu.be/uCsD3ZGzMgE_

_OK. So it's a kinda well-known math/compsci problem. You get to play with it._

_...Oh yeah - if you plan on working at home or on a laptop and didn't install DejaVu Sans Mono like you were asked to in assignment one, you probably want to do that now. Some of the characters you need to print out might not display correctly otherwise._

### Heads-up

So you might be tempted to see if there's a solution for this problem already out there on the interwebs.

There are! **Lots!**

...and none of them are at all like what you're doing here.

### What you're going to build

You'll be writing an app that asks the user for the number of folks in the Circle of Death. Then you'll display a table showing the progression of people killing/dying until there's one happy?lucky? person left.

To confirm that your app is finding the proper result, you'll also use the shorter, but more math-y, way of calculating the lucky person via binary numbers. (It's mentioned starting around the 12:00 mark in the video. You _have_ watched the video, right?)

Some example runs follow.

**Example Run 1:**
(User input is shown in **bold**.)

<pre>
How many people in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>11</b>

|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: 4 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|: 6 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|: 8 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|: 10 dies
|x|○|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|: 1 dies
|○|○|●|○|x|○|●|○|●|○|●|: 5 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|●|○|x|○|●|: 9 dies
|○|○|x|○|○|○|●|○|○|○|●|: 3 dies
|○|○|○|○|○|○|●|○|○|○|x|: 11 dies
|○|○|○|○|○|○|●|○|○|○|○|: 7 survives

The final survivor should be at position 7.

Do another run? <b>n</b>
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 1
>
> - This run shows you what happens with a run that has no user input errors.
> - Note that the user is asked whether they want to continue.
> - Since we can't draw a circle of people in the terminal window (and keep the assignment at a reasonable level of difficulty), we use a line of characters to represent the people in the circle. The first character in line is the person at the "top" of the circle.
> - Living people are marked with Unicode character '●' (U+25CF).
> - People killed on a previous step are marked with Unicode character '○' (U+25CB).
> - The person that dies in any given step is marked with a small 'x'.
> - At any given step, you should be able to explain why the person that died, died.
> - Take note of what's indicated in the right-hand side of the display.

**Example Run 2:**

<pre>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>x</b>
Not an integer.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>3.14</b>
Not an integer.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>0</b>
That's not greater than 0.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>4</b>

|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|: 4 dies
|●|○|x|○|: 3 dies
|●|○|○|○|: 1 survives

The final survivor should be at position 1.

Do another run? <b>n</b>
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 2
>
> This run shows you that when invalid data is entered, the user is pestered until they enter something correctly.

**Example Run 3:**

<pre>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? 2

|●|●|: start
|●|x|: 2 dies
|●|○|: 1 survives

The final survivor should be at position 1.

Do another run? y
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? -2
That's not greater than 0.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? 5

|●|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|●|: 4 dies
|x|○|●|○|●|: 1 dies
|○|○|●|○|x|: 5 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|: 3 survives

The final survivor should be at position 3.

Do another run? yes
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? 9

|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|: 4 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|: 6 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|: 8 dies
|x|○|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|: 1 dies

|○|○|●|○|○|○|●|○|x|: 9 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|x|○|○|: 7 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|○|○|○|: 3 survives

The final survivor should be at position 3.

Do another run? arglebargle
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 3
>
> - Another run occurs if `y` or `yes` (both case insensitive) is entered.
> - Another run won't occur if anything other than y/yes is entered.

### Notes

- In order to handle the problem of a user entering a non-integer, typically we can go one of two routes here:

  - use Scanner's `hasNextInt` method, or
  - use String's `matches` method

  Either way is acceptable for this assignment.

- Solutions to this problem that you find online to this problem are going about it **very** differently from what we're doing here.
- To help you reach your solution, write down a number of examples of different sizes. This will help you understand what steps are going to be needed to create the table.
- Handling the binary calculation of the surviving person might seem intimidating...until you look in the Integer API. There are two methods that make this part of the assignment delightfully straightforward. (This is a good lesson...knowing your common APIs is an insanely valuable skill.)
