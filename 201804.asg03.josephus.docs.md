# Assignment 03

## Challenge: The Josephus Problem

### Preamble

_Spend 14 minutes of your life and watch this video first: https://youtu.be/uCsD3ZGzMgE_

_..Back now? So the Josephus Problem is a kinda well-known math/compsci problem. You get to solve it using the power of loops._

_If you plan on working at home or on a laptop and didn't install DejaVu Sans Mono like you were asked to in assignment one, you probably want to do that now. Some of the characters you need to print out **might** not display correctly otherwise._

### Heads-up

So you might be tempted to see if there's a solution for this problem already out there on the internet.

There are! **Lots!**

...and none of them are at all like what you're doing here. So I just saved you some time.

### What you're going to build

You'll be writing an app that asks the user for the number of folks in the Circle of Death (I just made up that term - it seems appropriate here, no?) Then you'll display a table showing the progression of people killing/dying until there's one happy?lucky? person left.

To confirm that your app is finding the proper result, you'll also use the shorter, but more math-y, way of calculating the lucky person via binary numbers. (It's mentioned starting around the 12:00 mark in the video. You _have_ watched the video, right?)

Some example runs follow.

**Example Run 1:**
(User input is shown in **bold**.)

<pre>
How many people in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>11</b>

|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: 4 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|: 6 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|: 8 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|: 10 dies
|x|○|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|: 1 dies
|○|○|●|○|x|○|●|○|●|○|●|: 5 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|●|○|x|○|●|: 9 dies
|○|○|x|○|○|○|●|○|○|○|●|: 3 dies
|○|○|○|○|○|○|●|○|○|○|x|: 11 dies
|○|○|○|○|○|○|●|○|○|○|○|: 7 survives

The final survivor should be at position 7.

Do another run? <b>n</b>

> Commentary on Run 1
>
> - This run shows you what happens with a run that has no user input errors.
> - Note that the user is asked whether they want to continue.
> - Since we can't draw a circle of people in the terminal window (and keep the assignment at a reasonable level of difficulty), we use a line of characters to represent the people in the circle. The first character in line is the person at the "top" of the circle.
> - Living people are marked with Unicode character '●' (U+25CF).
> - People killed on a previous step are marked with Unicode character '○' (U+25CB).
> - The person that dies in any given step is marked with a small 'x'.
> - Take note of what's indicated in the right-hand side of the display - sometimes it's the word 'start', sometimes it's 'x dies', and sometimes it's 'x survives'.
> - The 'final survivor' message is calculated using the math-y way of solving the problem.
> - Look at the output for this and the other samples - it's **really** important you can explain to yourself why the person that died was chosen. If you **can't** explain it to yourself, you're not ready to start coding yet.

**Example Run 2:**

<pre>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>x</b>
Not an integer.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>3.14</b>
Not an integer.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>0</b>
That's not greater than 0.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>4</b>

|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|: 4 dies
|●|○|x|○|: 3 dies
|●|○|○|○|: 1 survives

The final survivor should be at position 1.

Do another run? <b>n</b>
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 2

> This run shows you that when invalid data is entered, the user is pestered until they enter something correctly. Notice that the error message given is specific to the type of error encountered.

**Example Run 3:**

<pre>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>2</b>

|●|●|: start
|●|x|: 2 dies
|●|○|: 1 survives

The final survivor should be at position 1.

Do another run? <b>y</b>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>-2</b>
That's not greater than 0.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>5</b>

|●|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|●|: 4 dies
|x|○|●|○|●|: 1 dies
|○|○|●|○|x|: 5 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|: 3 survives

The final survivor should be at position 3.

Do another run? <b>yes</b>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>9</b>

|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: start

The final survivor should be at position 3.

Do another run? <b>arglebargle</b>

> Commentary on Run 3

> - Another run occurs if `y` or `yes` (both case insensitive) is entered.
> - Another run won't occur if anything other than y/yes is entered.

### Notes

- I **strongly** suggest you read all input from the user as a string and then figure out from there whether they entered in something valid or not. This means **not** using nextInt, but instead using nextLine and then converting the resulting string to an integer and seeing if it's a valid number or not.
  - the Integer.parseInt method is useful here
  - I've included a helper method (isNumber) that you can use here as well
- To help you reach your solution, write down a number of examples of different sizes on paper or on a whiteboard and work through them by hand, just like the dude did in the video. This will help you understand what steps are going to be needed in your solution.
- Handling the binary calculation of the surviving person might seem intimidating...until you look in the Integer API. There are two methods that make this part of the assignment delightfully straightforward - keep your eyes open for the word 'binary' for one. (This is a good lesson...knowing your common APIs is an insanely valuable skill.)
