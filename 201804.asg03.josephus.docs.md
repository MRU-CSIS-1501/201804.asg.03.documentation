# Assignment 03

## Challenge: The Josephus Problem

### Preamble

Spend 14 minutes of your life and watch this video first: https://youtu.be/uCsD3ZGzMgE

OK. So it's a kinda well-known math/compsci problem. You get to play with it.

### Heads-up

So you might be tempted to see if there's a solution already out there on the interwebs.

There are! Lots!

...and none of them are like what you're doing here. Just sayin'.

### What you're going to build

You'll be writing an app that asks the user for the number of folks in the Circle of Death. Then you'll display a table showing the progression of people killing/dying until there's one happy?lucky? person left.

You'll also toss in the shorter but more math-y way of calculating the lucky person via binary numbers. (It's mentioned starting around the 12:00 mark in the video. You *have* watched the video, right?)

Some example runs follow.

**Example Run 1:**
(User input is shown in **bold**.)
<pre>
How many people in the 'circle'? 5

|☥|☥|☥|☥|☥|: start
|☥|◎|☥|☥|☥|: 2 dies
|☥|☠|☥|◎|☥|: 4 dies
|◎|☠|☥|☠|☥|: 1 dies
|☠|☠|☥|☠|◎|: 5 dies
|☠|☠|☥|☠|☠|: 3 survives

The final survivor should be at position 3.

Continue? n

> Commentary on Run 1
> - This run shows you what happens with a run that has no user input errors.
> - Note how the character class selection was not case sensitive.
> - The * in the Notes column indicate the character has proficiency with that weapon.
> - You should be able to explain how each of the numbers in the table was generated;
otherwise, you don't yet fully understand the problem.


**Example Run 2:**
<pre>
Welcome to the DnD Damage Calculator.

What is the character's class  [(C)leric, (F)ighter, (R)ogue, (W)izard ]? <b>x</b>
        'x' is not a valid  character class. Using the default of Fighter instead.
What is the character's level [ 1-20 ]? <b>0</b>
        0 is not within the acceptable range of [1 - 20]. Using default value of 1 instead.
What is the character's strength [ 3-18 ]? <b>2</b>
        2 is not within the acceptable range of [3 - 18]. Using default value of 9 instead.
What is the character's dexterity [ 3-18 ]? <b>19</b>
        19 is not within the acceptable range of [3 - 18]. Using default value of 9 instead.


Here is the table for a 1st level Fighter (prof +2) with 9 STR(-1) and 9 DEX(-1):

Weapon     | Attack Roll Bonus | Damage (Type) | Notes
-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------
Dagger     | +1                | 0-3 (P)       | Simple*
Sickle     | +1                | 0-3 (S)       | Simple*
Maul       | +1                | 1-11 (B)      | Martial*
Rapier     | +1                | 0-7 (P)       | Martial*
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 2
> This run shows you that when invalid data is entered, a default value is used instead (and
the user is informed of this).

**Example Run 3:**
<pre>
Welcome to the DnD Damage Calculator.

What is the character's class  [(C)leric, (F)ighter, (R)ogue, (W)izard ]? <b>WIZARD</b>
What is the character's level [ 1-20 ]? <b>5</b>
What is the character's strength [ 3-18 ]? <b>3</b>
What is the character's dexterity [ 3-18 ]? <b>18</b>


Here is the table for a 5th level Wizard (prof +3) with 3 STR(-4) and 18 DEX(+4):

Weapon     | Attack Roll Bonus | Damage (Type) | Notes
-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------
Dagger     | +7                | 5-8 (P)       | Simple*
Sickle     | -4                | - (S)         | Simple
Maul       | -4                | 0-8 (B)       | Martial
Rapier     | +4                | 5-12 (P)      | Martial
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 3
> A few interesting things are going on here:
> - Only the first letter of the class entered by the user is used.
> - The damage range for the Sickle in this case was 0-0, so that was replaced by a dash.
> - The two finesse weapons (Dagger and Rapier) used the DEX ability modifier
instead of the usual STR modifier.



### Collateral Learning
- understanding source material
- working with other people's code (reading, understanding, and modifying)
