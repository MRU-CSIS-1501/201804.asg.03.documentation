# Assignment 03

## Challenge: The Gauge

### Preamble

I like gauges. They let you measure things. Who doesn't want to do that?

### What you're going to build

You'll be writing an app that represents a gauge that goes from 0 to some maximum user-specified value. While the user wants to continue, they can set the reading, add to the current reading, and subtract from the current reading.



Some example runs follow.

**Example Run 1:**
(User input is shown in **bold**.)

<pre>
Enter max gauge value. (>=10 and multiple of 10): 50
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃          ┃ 0
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> =40
reading: 40
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌  ┃ 40
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> =3
reading: 3
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃          ┃ 3
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> -10
reading: 0
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃          ┃ 0
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> +100
reading: 50
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌┃ 50
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> q

</pre>

> Commentary on Run 1
>
> - This run shows you what happens with a run that has no user input errors.
> - Note that the user is asked whether they want to continue.
> - Since we can't draw a circle of people in the terminal window (and keep the assignment at a reasonable level of difficulty), we use a line of characters to represent the people in the circle. The first character in line is the person at the "top" of the circle.
> - Living people are marked with Unicode character '●' (U+25CF).
> - People killed on a previous step are marked with Unicode character '○' (U+25CB).
> - The person that dies in any given step is marked with a small 'x'.
> - At any given step, you should be able to explain why the person that died, died.
> - Take note of what's indicated in the right-hand side of the display.

**Example Run 2:**

<pre>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>x</b>
Not an integer.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>3.14</b>
Not an integer.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>0</b>
That's not greater than 0.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? <b>4</b>

|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|: 4 dies
|●|○|x|○|: 3 dies
|●|○|○|○|: 1 survives

The final survivor should be at position 1.

Do another run? <b>n</b>
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 2

> This run shows you that when invalid data is entered, the user is pestered until they enter something correctly.

**Example Run 3:**

<pre>
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? 2

|●|●|: start
|●|x|: 2 dies
|●|○|: 1 survives

The final survivor should be at position 1.

Do another run? y
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? -2
That's not greater than 0.
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? 5

|●|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|●|: 4 dies
|x|○|●|○|●|: 1 dies
|○|○|●|○|x|: 5 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|: 3 survives

The final survivor should be at position 3.

Do another run? yes
How many people (> 0) in the 'Circle of Death'? 9

|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: start
|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|●|●|: 2 dies
|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|●|●|: 4 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|●|●|: 6 dies
|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|x|●|: 8 dies
|x|○|●|○|●|○|●|○|●|: 1 dies
|○|○|●|○|x|○|●|○|●|: 5 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|●|○|x|: 9 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|x|○|○|: 7 dies
|○|○|●|○|○|○|○|○|○|: 3 survives

The final survivor should be at position 3.

Do another run? arglebargle
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 3
>
> - Another run occurs if `y` or `yes` (both case insensitive) is entered.
> - Another run won't occur if anything other than y/yes is entered.

### Notes

- In order to handle the problem of a user entering a non-integer, typically we can go one of two routes here:

  - use Scanner's `hasNextInt` method, or
  - use String's `matches` method

  Either way is acceptable for this assignment.

- Solutions to this problem that you find online to this problem are going about it **very** differently from what we're doing here.
- To help you reach your solution, write down a number of examples of different sizes. This will help you understand what steps are going to be needed to create the table.
- Handling the binary calculation of the surviving person might seem intimidating...until you look in the Integer API. There are two methods that make this part of the assignment delightfully straightforward. (This is a good lesson...knowing your common APIs is an insanely valuable skill.)
