# Assignment 03

## Challenge: The Gauge

### Preamble

_I like gauges. They let you gauge things. Who doesn't want to do that?_

### What you're going to build

You'll be writing an app that represents a gauge that can visually display readings that go from 0 to some maximum user-specified value. While the user wants to continue, they can set the reading, add to the current reading, and subtract from the current reading - and the gauge will display the results.

#### An important clarification

A gauge is meant to visually display a _reading_ of some sort. Examples of readings are things like intensity of sound (decibels), or speed (km/h), or radiation levels (rads).

Gauges are limited in the sense that they can only display some maximum value, even though the reading itself might be over that maximum. (Perhaps you've seen a movie where a policeman working a speed trap measures some car - or perhaps something else! - that goes by super-fast...and their radar gun pegs out at some max value.)

To succeed with this challenge, you'll have to be careful to separate the concept of a **reading** from the gauge **display**. For example, on a gauge that maxes out at 100, while you can have a **reading** of 180, the gauge itself will only **display** 100.

### What the app does

When the app starts, the user will be prompted for the maximum value this particular gauge can display; to make your lives easier (because I **do** care, you know), the maximum must be a positive multiple of 10. (So 10, 20, 180, 100130, etc are all fine, but 5, 19, 1023, etc are not.)

From that point onward, the following is done repeatedly until the user decides to quit:

1. the gauge is displayed (see example runs below for what it looks like)
1. a prompt (`>`) is displayed
1. if the user enters
    - `=[some integer]`, the reading becomes that number
    - `+[some integer]`, the reading is increased by that number
    - `-[some integer]`, the reading is decreased by that number
    - `q` or `Q`, the app ends
    - anything else, an `Invalid entry` message is displayed and you go back to step 2

**Example Run 1:**
(User input is shown in **bold**.)

<pre>
Max displayable gauge value (positive multiple of 10): 10
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃          ┃ 0
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> q
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 1
>
> - Here's a basic run with no problems with the max gauge value.
> - After a successful max gauge entry, we always see this starting gauge - it has room for 10 bars and the current reading is 0.

**Example Run 2:**

<pre>
Max displayable gauge value (positive multiple of 10): 20
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃          ┃ 0
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> =12
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃▌▌▌▌▌▌    ┃ 12
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> Q
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 2
>
> - This time, we set the max gauge reading to 20.
> - The reading is set to 12 (using `=12`) and the correct number of bars (6) are shown. Make sure you understand why there are 6 bars!
> - We quit with a `Q` this time.

**Example Run 3:**

<pre>
Max displayable gauge value (positive multiple of 10): hi
Not an integer.
Max displayable gauge value (positive multiple of 10):
Not an integer.
Max displayable gauge value (positive multiple of 10): 10.0
Not an integer.
Max displayable gauge value (positive multiple of 10): -10
Not a positive multiple of 10.
Max displayable gauge value (positive multiple of 10): 13
Not a positive multiple of 10.
Max displayable gauge value (positive multiple of 10): 20
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃          ┃ 0
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> q
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 3
>
> - Here we see how things go when the max gauge value is entered incorrectly. You don't have to have the same error messages. (If you want full design marks, your error messages _should_ give the user an indication what the problem is.)

**Example Run 4:**

<pre>
Max displayable gauge value (positive multiple of 10): 100
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃          ┃ 0
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> =98
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌ ┃ 98
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> 2
Invalid entry.
> a
Invalid entry.
>
Invalid entry.
> +a
Invalid entry.
> +1
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌ ┃ 99
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> +2
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌┃ 101
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> -150
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃          ┃ -49
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> +60
┏━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃▌         ┃ 11
┗━━━━━━━━━━┛
> q
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 4
>
> - We set the reading to 98...and then things go wrong and we see how a variety of command errors are handled. You don't need to have the same error message. You **don't** need to be descriptive with these error messages for full design marks (though if you want to challenge yourself, go right ahead!).
> - Pay careful attention to what happens when we go over the max gauge value and under 0.

### Notes

- Taking care of input errors is _always_ a hassle. To make things easy for you, there's a helper method `isNumber` in the starting code. You don't _have_ to use it...but it is meant to help you!
- If you're tests are failing, it might be a bit confusing to figure out what's wrong. Let's look at what an example test looks like:

<pre>
 30|3|=a|=35|Q,  ┃          ┃ 0 ┃▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌┃ 35
</pre>
> **Translation**
>
> The first part (before the comma) is what the test sends as input to your program: you can pretend that somebody is typing what you see between the `|` symbols at the keyboard. In this case, this imaginary "user" types in:
> - `30` at the max displayable gauge prompt (this is valid, so the standard empty gauge should appear),
> - `3` at the reading prompt (this is an error, so the user should need to enter in another value)
> - `=a` at the next reading prompt (also an error)
> - `=35` at the next prompt (this is ok, so a full 10-bar gauge should appear along with the `35` reading)
> - `Q` to end the application
>
>The second part (after the comma) is what is expected to be seen on the console when the program is run with the above inputs:
> - the first bit <pre>┃          ┃ 0</pre> shows the middle part of the gauge that should appear after the inital `30` is entered
> - the second bit <pre>┃▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌▌┃ 35</pre> shows the middle part of the gauge that should appear after the `=35` is entered
